## How to run flask GUI with electron
### Install flask
```
pip install flask
```
To test it, you can navigate to the flask_test directory and run app.py and the terminal should provide you with a link you can open in your browser to see the GUI. Next, we want to run that GUI in a window rather than a browser.

### Install Node.js
Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

Next, navigate to the jeopardy-electron directory and run these three commands:
```
npm init -y
```
```
npm install electron
```
```
npm start
```
You should see the same GUI as before but this time in a window! 
If you run into any issues just copy and paste these instructions into ChatGPT and tell it where you're having trouble.
